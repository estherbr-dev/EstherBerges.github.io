									My main mission was to work on different levels of the game. Later on, I became fond of technical design and grew into a technical referent on some key features of the game.</p>

									<p>Inspired by the classic game Mario Bros, we created a platformer game for mobiles with levels that are semi-proceduraly generated!
									The player has to run and jump while avoiding traps and collecting different treasures to boost his performance or unlock new characters!<br/>
									My missions in this game were to program all the gameplay features, social systems, and creating the daily challenge game mode! I also worked on the level blocks used for our semi-procedural system.</p>
